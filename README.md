# XS

Look at the left side of "cd", it is xs!  
  
xs is an enhanced version of the standard "cd" command, we can reach the target directory by browse file system by simple arrow keys.  

Just use xs and forgot cd~

```bash
$ xs

then browse the filesystem with simple arrow keystrokes, press enter to confirm.

or press 'H' or '?' while running xs.
