# XS

Look at the left side of "cd", it is xs!  
  
The program xs is used to perform extra fast directory changes. Usually to change a directory the user is required to enter a command like, e.g. cd
/usr/local/bin, in many cases this is a tedious task.  

xs is an enhanced version of the standard "cd" command, we can reach the target directory by browse file system by simple arrow keys.  

Just use xs and forgot cd~  

# Usage

do:

```bash
$ xs
```

then browse the filesystem with simple arrow keystrokes, press enter to confirm.

# Installation

Installation is easy, do:

```bash
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

For more information try:

```bash
$ man xs
```

or press 'H' or '?' while running xs.
